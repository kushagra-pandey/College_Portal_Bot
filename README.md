# College_Portal_Bot
Are you a high school senior and don't feel like typing in your username and password for your college portal logins during
decision day? Then this bot is just for you!

This is a bot that will open a separate chrome window for each college portal you call and fill in the username and password
you specify in the program into the portal, and it logs in by itself and opens up your decision.

To use:
  1) Fill out the strings in the code where it says "Enter your _____ here". Do not remove the quotation marks!
  2) If you want to run one college (ex ucla), then at the very bottom type in ucla(). Then just sit back, relax, and run the script.
